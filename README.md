# CrossMgr Website

This is the "code" for the cross mgr website. It uses Spotlight template from "tooplate.com" ([https://www.tooplate.com/live/2051-spot-light}) to build a simple website.

Java script code pulls in releases and other information from github to present the user with a "nice" interface. It is completely static and requires no database to run. It uses the github api to get information.
